      Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing
      the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML
      or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a
      cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
      JavaScript.

      CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation,
      including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content
      accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification
      of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share
      formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which
      reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable
      the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the
      pages that share the file and its formatting.
